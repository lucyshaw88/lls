<h2><b>MY SWEATER BUSINESS</b></h2>
</p>

Today, I am still knitting. I make Sweaters, Vest, socks, slippers, toques, scarfs and children sweaters plus more. I enjoy knitting sweaters to your design and size.
It takes me about a week or two to make a sweater, depending on size. I usually do my knitting in the evenings, weekends and my days off work. I take your order over the phone, email, or texting which ever how you communicate.
My favorite’s designs are Eagle, Raven, Bear and Whale/Salmon. With some pattern designs I may not have but you can send me an idea what you are wanting and I can make it work.
For example one of my customers were interested in a very long sweater and didn’t know how at first but I made it happen and this sweater took me about a two weeks because I kept knitting in the evening and weekend to get it done. As you see my picture of my work. Yay! She’s a happy customer!

<p>
<strong>Family Design Patterns</strong> that was shared with me from my mom:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear – represents strenght, family, courage and health.</li>
<li>Eagle – symbolizes grace, and power.</li>
<li>Raven – symbolic as a trickster and fierce as a mischief maker.</li>
<li>Whale – symbolizes family, romance, harmony, travel and protection.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>ABOUT SWEATER MAKING</b></h3>
</p>
 When I get an order to make a sweater I will gather all my knitting needles, design, wool to certain colors that the customer likes. I will first look at size and determine how many needles and wool I need to use.
The knitted sweaters do last a long time and keeps you very warm and water resistant.
If you having your sweater gifted to another person don’t worry about getting sizing properly measured, I still can determine by looking at their photos or seeing them in person. I have included the size chart to give you an idea how I would measure you or give me the sizing for a special gift.

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
Today, I still don’t have a knitted sweater or vest for myself. I keep saying one day I will make myself one with my favorite eagle design. Maybe this will be the year to definitely make me one.
